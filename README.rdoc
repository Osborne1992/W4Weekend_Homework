Week 4 Weekend Homework while at CodeClan.

A COOKBOOK!

This particular bit of work I was fairly happy with while learning. An application on which you can sign up and add cooking recipes, ingredients, assign categories to recipes and so on.
Not the best cookbook in the world, but still a nice for what it is during my learning to program.
